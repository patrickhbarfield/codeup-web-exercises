Sir Markle does indeed Sparkle, and he did showeth us a few clews as to why. Once upon a time Sir Markle did indeed sally forth
from his homestead of VA upon after some eight years he decided, like any right-minded person, to land in the blessed country of Texas.
In a past life, Sir Markle served with valor in the great Army of the United States as a Medic with the  82nd Airborne, which has been known to coerce folk to jump from aeroplanes with little but a parachute and good luck sir! 
One day, as Sir Markle was floating from the sky he deigned to learn the foreign tongue of Spanish, which assuredly won him the hand of his bride from a southern clime.
 His joy and industry did bear fruit in the restaurant business, whereupon he gazed at a young triksters Linux terminal trying to upsell him some clever software.  His  recognition of the mark of the Mint was also 
mentioned.  What a distro!
Sir Markle did in the past own a restaurant in Columbia South America, but  
Now in the place of Soup, rice, fruit juice, and your main meat, Sir Markle now cooks up escape characters and command line recipes.

All of the spare time that he has now lost used to be dedicated to the perusing of various genre's in book form.    
He always gravitated to tech as a kid, so now in place of a glorious chute, Sir Markle has opted for the rabbit hole that is html and has deigned to make his own darn software. 
 He had a need, and that is whenceforth yon innovation happens.  For example, Sir Markle toyed with Kali linux with VM's and what-not, things of which his grand audience had rare knowledge of.
