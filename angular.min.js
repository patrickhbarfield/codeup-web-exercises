/*// class attribute on html,
you give your element certain classes
they h ave behanviors behind the scenes you cant see
so when you give it a class/style, it goes.  Colors
are built into bootstrap.  Flexbox is in bootstrap
works the same way as in vanilla.
    ex. instead of seledt and display flex in css or in
    imbedded stylesheet, just give it a class of d-flex.constructor*/
