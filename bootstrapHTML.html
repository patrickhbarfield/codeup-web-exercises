    creating content that only shows up when you click a certain button.
    build your own pizza tab, show a card that holds a card.
    cards in side of cards, and checkboxes inside of those.  there will be
    alot of divs in there.  make sure you name your structure and elements
    appropriately.  give them id's and classes to keep them distinguished.
    and make sure you are methodical on how you add code, and that you have
    a plan before you start throwing stuff in there.

    Must be using bootsrrap 4.  website doesn't need to be functional.  Navbar
    just needs to look this way.  No clicks etc. drop downs need to work, but
    previous next doesn't need to be functional.

    There is a tab and tab panes, but there isn't something for hoking them up.
    we have to do that in Javascript themselves.  Hqve the cards, chees and sauce, an
    and display options, THEN get them to work with the tab pains.  Content first
    then functionailty.  Look in Navs, and you can see examples.

    click on javascript behavior on the right, and you will see tha tit is
    funcitonal.
<!--// a framework binds you to what you do, controls the flow.  you have
    to use the classes that bootsrap defines.-->
<!--
    //flexbox and grid don't work together.  ex. if you are using
    bootstrap grid on the element, and in your custom css you are
    trying to make it a flexbox, problems.  But custom coloring will
    work well.  Put things in with intentionality, and notice where
    they aren't changing.  Treat it just like html.  -->
    <!--
    the class is disabled, it is class heavy.  the nav element has 4 classes,
    you can put them all in the same set of quotation makrs.  -->
<!--
    bg-light  is what sets background.
    Bootstrap grid and handburgers is going to be a lesson on its own.-->

 <!--   layout documentaiton has containers with articulated breakpoints.
    the div class of container-sm ms lg, depends on where you want to apply
    the container.  That is all part of bootstrap grid.

    We saw componenets, which are like items you can put in your document, nav bar
    cards, buttons.
    Utilities are tools that you can use to hep customise those things.

    when you have a . before it, it's reminding you it is a class.  but don't use the
    dot

    When using bootstrap, or any other framework, use it as much as you can
    before you start customizing it.

    Example would be to do custom color, if there isn't simple.
    never uses grid, uses bootstrap grid.  leverage the framework for what it can
    help you with, and what

    explore other things/frameworks outside of bootstrap.  materialize css is cool, and tailwind
is very customizable.  On capstone, you can use what you want-->
