In the earlier chapters, we have seen how to draw 2D shapes on an XY plane. In addition to these 2D shapes, we can draw several other 3D shapes as well using JavaFX.
3D Shape

In general, a 3D shape is a geometrical figure that can be drawn on the XYZ plane. These include a Cylinder, Sphere and a Box.

    Each of the above mentioned 3D shape is represented by a class and all these classes belong to the package javafx.scene.shape. The class named Shape3D is the base class of all the 3-Dimensional shapes in JavaFX.
    Creating a 3D Shape

To create a 3-Dimensional shape, you need to −

    Instantiate the respective class of the required 3D shape.

    Set the properties of the 3D shape.

    Add the 3D shape object to the group.

    Instantiating the Respective Class

To create a 3-Dimensional shape, first of all you need to instantiate its respective class. For example, if you want to create a 3D box, you need to instantiate the class named Box as follows −

Box box = new Box();

Setting the Properties of the Shape

After instantiating the class, you need to set the properties for the shape using the setter methods.

    For example, to draw a 3D box you need to pass its Width, Height, Depth. You can specify these values using their respective setter methods as follows −

//Setting the properties of the Box
box.setWidth(200.0);
box.setHeight(400.0);
box.setDepth(200.0);

Adding the Shape Object to the Group

Finally, you need to add the object of the shape to the group by passing it as a parameter of the constructor as shown below.

//Creating a Group object
    Group root = new Group(box);

The following table gives you the list of various 3D shapes provided by JavaFX.
    S.No 	Shape & Description
1 	Box

A cuboid is a three-dimensional shape with a length (depth), width, and a height.

    In JavaFX a three-dimensional box is represented by a class named Box. This class belongs to the package javafx.scene.shape.

    By instantiating this class, you can create a Box node in JavaFX.

    This class has 3 properties of the double datatype namely −

    width − The width of the box.

    height − The height of the box.

    depth − The depth of the box.

2 	Cylinder

A cylinder is a closed solid that has two parallel (mostly circular) bases connected by a curved surface.

    It is described by two parameters, namely, the radius of its circular base and the height of the cylinder.

    In JavaFX, a cylinder is represented by a class named Cylinder. This class belongs to the package javafx.scene.shape.

    By instantiating this class, you can create a cylinder node in JavaFX. This class has 2 properties of the double datatype namely −

    height − The height of the Cylinder.

    radius − The radius of the Cylinder.

3 	Sphere

A sphere is defined as the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in a 3D space. This distance r is the radius of the sphere and the given point is the centre of the sphere.

    In JavaFX, a sphere is represented by a class named Sphere. This class belongs to the package javafx.scene.shape.

    By instantiating this class, you can create a sphere node in JavaFX.

    This class has a property named radius of double datatype. It represents the radius of a Sphere.
    Properties of 3D Objects

For all the 3 Dimensional objects, you can set various properties like Cull Face, Drawing Mode, Material.

    The following section discusses the properties of 3D objects.
    Cull Face

In general, culling is the removal of improperly oriented parts of a shape (which are not visible in the view area).

The Cull Face property is of the type CullFace and it represents the Cull Face of a 3D shape. You can set the Cull Face of a shape using the method setCullFace() as shown below −

box.setCullFace(CullFace.NONE);

The stroke type of a shape can be −

    None − No culling is performed (CullFace.NONE).

    Front − All the front facing polygons are culled. (CullFace.FRONT).

    Back − All the back facing polygons are culled. (StrokeType.BACK).

    By default, the cull face of a 3-Dimensional shape is Back.
    Example

The following program is an example which demonstrates various cull faces of the sphere. Save this code in a file with the name SphereCullFace.java.

    import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Group;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.shape.CullFace;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import javafx.scene.shape.Sphere;

public class SphereCullFace extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
    //Drawing Sphere1
    Sphere sphere1 = new Sphere();

    //Setting the radius of the Sphere
    sphere1.setRadius(50.0);

    //Setting the position of the sphere
    sphere1.setTranslateX(100);
    sphere1.setTranslateY(150);

    //setting the cull face of the sphere to front
    sphere1.setCullFace(CullFace.FRONT);

    //Drawing Sphere2
    Sphere sphere2 = new Sphere();

    //Setting the radius of the Sphere
    sphere2.setRadius(50.0);

    //Setting the position of the sphere
    sphere2.setTranslateX(300);
    sphere2.setTranslateY(150);

    //Setting the cull face of the sphere to back
    sphere2.setCullFace(CullFace.BACK);

    //Drawing Sphere3
    Sphere sphere3 = new Sphere();

    //Setting the radius of the Sphere
    sphere3.setRadius(50.0);

    //Setting the position of the sphere
    sphere3.setTranslateX(500);
    sphere3.setTranslateY(150);

    //Setting the cull face of the sphere to none
    sphere2.setCullFace(CullFace.NONE);

    //Creating a Group object
    Group root = new Group(sphere1, sphere2, sphere3);

    //Creating a scene object
    Scene scene = new Scene(root, 600, 300);

    //Setting title to the Stage
    stage.setTitle("Drawing a Sphere");

    //Adding scene to the stage
    stage.setScene(scene);

    //Displaying the contents of the stage
    stage.show();
}
public static void main(String args[]){
    launch(args);
}
}

Compile and execute the saved Java file from the command prompt using the following commands.

    javac SphereCullFace.java
java SphereCullFace
